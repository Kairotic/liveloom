This work is situated within the ERC PENELOPE project lead by Ellen
Harlizius-Kl√ºck, against the background of her work exploring the
computational nature of weaving
[e.g. @harlizius_kluck_ellen_2017_3342554]. The aims of the overall
PENELOPE project are to explore weaving as a technical mode of
existence, and to re-establish its place in the history of science and
technology. Within this context, the present paper looks to explore
the relation between live coding and improvisation at the loom, with
the longer term goal to help communicate the complex nature of weaving
structures.



I am grateful for all the input and feedback from colleagues and
workshop participants in this work.

This research is conducted by the PENELOPE project, with funding from
